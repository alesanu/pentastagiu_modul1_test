Name the difference between agile & v-model. (Please specify some roles and cycles for these)

V-model is a software development model that is based on the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle as described in a typical Waterfall model of software development and its associated phase of testing.
Agile testing is an iterative-incremental software development model that follows the rules of the agile manifesto, treating software development as the customer of testing.


The cycle usually consists of Requirement Analysis, Design, Development, Testing and Maintenance.

- Product Owner
- Scrum Master/Kanban Coach
- Development Team (Testers/Developers alike)
- Stakeholders


Roles in the V-Model:
