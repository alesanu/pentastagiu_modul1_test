Name the difference between agile & v-model. (Please specify some roles and cycles for these)



V-model: Testing happens at the end, right before release. The testing gets “squished” because coding takes longer than expected, and because teams get into a code-and-fix cycle at the end.
Roles: Project managers, stakeholder

Agile: is iterative and incremental. This means that the testers test each increment of coding as soon as it is finished.
Iteration might be as short as one week, or as long as a month. 
The team builds and tests a little bit of code, making sure it works correctly, and then moves on to next piece that needs to be built. 
Programmers never get ahead of the testers, because a story is not “done” until it has been tested.
Roles: Scrum master, Product owner, stakeholder
