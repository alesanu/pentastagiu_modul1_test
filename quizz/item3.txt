Name the difference between agile & v-model. (Please specify some roles and cycles for these)

One key difference between the two is flexibility. V-model is rigid, sequential, easier to manage though, while agile allows making changes in any phase.
From a testing perspective, in the v-model each phase is tested separateley, while in agile testing is done after each release.

V-model phases could be:
(1) Requirement specification
(2) Functional specification
(3) Technical specification
(4) Program specification
(5) Code
(6) Unit testing
(7) Integration testing
(8) System testing
(9) Acceptance testing

Agile phases could be:
(1) Define iteration requirement.
(2) Build iteration.
(3) Test iteration.
This sequence would be repeated for each iteration until an acceptable product has been developed.
