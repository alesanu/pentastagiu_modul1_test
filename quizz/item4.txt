Please state what is black box testing? How about white box testing? You can also give an example.

Black Box:
Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. 
This method of test can be applied virtually to every level of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance. 
It is sometimes referred to as specification-based testing.
