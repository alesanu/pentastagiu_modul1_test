In the images folder you have a login form. Create Test Cases for the given form.

Please state the testing types(functional, non-functional, black box, white box, design technique) for each TC created.

A. Functional test scenarios: 
a. Blackbox:

1. Create account successfully with facebook
2. Create account successfully with G+
3. Create account successfully with in
4. Create account successfully filling in the form with valid inputs
5. Sign is successfully with already created account
6. depending on the specs, boundary and equivalence partitioning on each of the fields;


Negative scenarios: 
1. Create account with invalid format for the filed name
2. Create account with invalid format for the filed email
3. Create account with invalid format for the filed password
4. Create account with empty field (s) (one field empty, more fields empty)
5. Create account with already registered email address (same with F, G+, in)

b. Grey box
1. validate the data for new registered account is correctly saved in the data base 

Non functional:

1. login with 1=1 or a always true sql
2. create user - login - logout - validate that correct logout is done and session is no longer active
3. create large number of accounts (maybe a backend service can be used for this) and validate they are create correctly 
4. create 2 account in the same time (maybe a backend service can be used for this) and validate that they are both created correctly;
5. fill in create account form with valid data - back - forward - validate that data sensitive data are no longer in the fields
6. make sure that password is encoded

Note: I have included only the scenarios so for now, the tests cases will follo
