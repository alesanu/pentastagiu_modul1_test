In the images folder you have a login form. Create Test Cases for the given form.

* Verify if a user will be able to login using social media account while already logged into the specific account.
* Verify if a user will be able to login using social media account while not being logged into the specific account - the user should be redirected to the social media service login page and once logged in there redirected to their Diprella account maybe?
