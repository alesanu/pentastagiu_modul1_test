What is regression? What is retesting?

Regression Testing is defined as a type of software testing to confirm that a recent program or code change has not adversely
 affected existing features.

Regression Testing is nothing but a full or partial selection of already executed test cases which are re-executed to
 ensure existing functionalities work fine.

This testing is done to make sure that new code changes should not have side effects on the existing functionalities.
 It ensures that the old code still works once the new code changes are done.

Retesting is testing of a particular bug after it has been fixed. Usually tester raises the bug when they find it while
 testing the product or its component. This bug is assigned to a developer and he fixes it. Post fixing the bug is assigned
 to the tester for its verification.
