What is regression? What is retesting?

Answer:
Regression testing is run after each new feature added to the current application version. 
Its scope is to make sure that there is no bug or issue added to the current version of the app.

Retesting is run after a bug fix. Its scope is to make sure that the bug has been fixed and there  are  no other issues.
