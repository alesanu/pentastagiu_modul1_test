What is regression? What is retesting?

Regression testing is checking that there are no additional problems in previously tested software, retesting is demonstrating that the reported defect has been fixed.
Regression testing is testing that nothing has regressed. 
Retesting (or confirmation testing) confirms the fix is correct by running the same test after the fix has been made.
