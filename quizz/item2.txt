What is the relationship between the following: error, bug, defect, fault, failure.

A mistake in coding is called Error.
An error found by the tester is called Defect.
A defect accepted by development team then it is called Bug
A fault is an incorrect step in the development.
A build does not meet the requirements then it is Failure.

It's all down to the person who finds it, and to the timing and to the environment it is found in.
The sooner the errors and faults are found, the smaller the risk to get to a FAILURE.
