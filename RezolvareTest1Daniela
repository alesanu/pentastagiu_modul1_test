Fault means a mistake.
item3. Name the difference between agile & v-model. (Please specify some roles and cycles for these)
A: Agile means that for each piece of the software product is taken into a sprint and finished.
On V-model the entire software product is first developed and then tested (the big disadvantage of this model is when it comes to a change)
item4. Please state what is black box testing? How about white box testing? You can also give an example.
Black box testing means testing without having access to the code and white box testing implies having access to the code. Black box: boundary testing, equivalence partitioning, etc. White box testing: unit tests
